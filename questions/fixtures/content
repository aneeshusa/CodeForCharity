Welcome to Bit_by_bit, where we are trying to improve the world, one line of code at a time!  <br><br> With every challenge you complete, we will donate money to the World Wildlife Fund, to help save endangered species. Also, keep an eye on Tim the Snake. He likes to share cool facts about animals or tips on how to improve the environment.    <br><br> In this brief tutorial, you will learn the basics of Javascript. Javascript is a programming language that allows you to talk to a browser window just like this one. With Javascript, you can tell objects in the browser window what to do.  <br><br> First we are going to talk about variables! Variables are containers that can hold anything you want. They can hold words or numbers or anything at all!  <br><br> In the first challenge we are going to make a variable that holds a string. A string is simply a collections of letters, surrounded by quotation marks. For example, \u201chello\u201d is a string. \u201cI like cheese\u201d is also a string. In the coding block below, there is a variable called \u201cmy_pet\u201d.
